This assignment was incredibly difficult, especially for an assigmnet that took place in the third week of the class. This is a password generator that can use any combination of capital letters, lower cased letters, numbers and special characters. A lot of help and input went into getting this thing to run, and while I developed some of the basic code, I did get a lot of input for the execution of the program. I was unable to get it to do it for at least 8 characters and no more than 128 and have it run. I put code down for that criteria, but was unable to get it to run. I also tried to send back an error message if no options of characters were selected, but ran into similar complications when I tried to execute the code.
